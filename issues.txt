1. full document search not enabled(issue with searchable grails plugin)
2. volunteer button does not work
3. Try and upgrade to grails 3 (try gradually at first, and if that fails..just jump in)
   for the purpose of:
        3.1 updating app engine
        3.2 updating to a current app engine version may help us with our plugin issues

4. Add Twitter functionality such that users can login to their dashboards and  post event updates to their twitter feeds.

5. User-Friendly URLs don't work...namely because there is no place
in the event creation forms to set the nick-name field.  I think
I am going to go about this in an entirely different way....we shall
see...

6. We need a feature where people can register

7. We need to implement Spring security
